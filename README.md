## This is the repository of our CS454: AI Based Software Engineering class project by team 11. 

The project idea is based on the homework 2 of the same class and the code-base is also based on that. 

To run the code, use bash command: `python sbst_all.py filepath gpt_init gpt_jump`

Replace filepath with a filepath from `ex` folder, example, `ex/example1.py`. For `gpt_init` and `gpt_jump` use either "True" or "False" to indicate whether you want to initialize/make a jump using ChatGPT
