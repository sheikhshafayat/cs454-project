## This is the repository of our CS454: AI Based Software Engineering class project by team 11. 

The project idea is based on the homework 2 of the same class and the code-base is also based on that. 

First, you have to install modules via requirements.txt.

    pip install requirements.txt

Second, you have to get an openai api key and save it in 'openai-api-.txt'.
To run the code, use bash command: `python sbst_all_inputs.py filepath gpt_init gpt_jump` (or see the bash file)


Replace filepath with a filepath from `ex` folder, example, `ex/example1.py`. For `gpt_init` and `gpt_jump` use either "True" or "False" to indicate whether you want to initialize/make a jump using ChatGPT
